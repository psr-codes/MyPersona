## 📖 Executive Summary

**MyPersona (zk-KYC)** is a decentralized, privacy-first identity framework designed to solve the **"Tokenised KYC"** challenge.

We are moving India from a fragmented, insecure identity model to a unified, private one.

![The Problem vs. The Solution](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gg-dl/ABS2GSmoJzJWxJiWhrV2GGJsmTlzoJp7etQRFQvDCRpD36EZZWC_yyZeNmj40OVdG-4ogbNyxHcTF5g0sNxKFvn4V38JnaMzwYn5wTZa39_XU_04TBQXEVC64eZxvbPQnuNe5VIpIWoLkD7la6BnUzbD4NY4kBHMNriHAFCZO7-HqpiRx7CA2g=s1024-rj)

In the current financial ecosystem, users must repeatedly share sensitive documents (Aadhaar, PAN) with every new service, creating redundant data silos and "Honey Pots" for hackers. MyPersona replaces this with a **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** model.

We enable users to convert their KYC into **reusable, tamper-proof digital tokens** stored on their mobile devices. Using **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**, users can prove eligibility without revealing their underlying data.

## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🔐 Zero-Knowledge Privacy** | Users prove facts (Age, Income) without sharing raw documents. Data never leaves the user's phone. |
| **💸 Truly Gas-less UX** | Built on a **Meta-Transaction Relayer**. Users perform verifications without owning crypto or paying gas fees. |
| **🚦 Regulatory Kill-Switch** | Smart contracts feature a **`Pausable`** module, allowing the RBI/Admin to freeze the system instantly during security threats. |
| **🔄 Interoperable** | Built on **W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**. Compatible with existing standards like DigiLocker and CKYCR. |
| **📱 Offline-Ready** | Proof generation happens locally on the device using lightweight **Circom** circuits (Groth16). |

## 🧠 How it Works: The ZKP Magic

The core of our solution is the Zero-Knowledge Proof. It allows a user to prove a claim to a service provider (Verifier) without revealing the data behind that claim.

![ZKP Mechanism Explanation](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gg-dl/ABS2GSnT1k0cQdOKAVwqzsGTqL--nsMIbTIwcYf5PSdUkuW8Ifpffc4D4UseNbBQvggot3O7Gz1Guut44SDaX3KsOfO10RqBrSzkeiKjM6p6xL81Gl8vNp4jdkDqzHJrSrjRJ_3hR8e5kUlE2IgDNEMkiuDQl0yLMJtJhhzTi4nCMvyrPkxv2Q=s1024-rj
)

As shown above, the user's phone generates a cryptographic proof locally. The Verifier (e.g., a Mutual Fund App) receives only a "Yes/No" answer, ensuring absolute privacy.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Workflow

The solution operates on a trust triangle between the **Issuer** (Bank), **Holder** (User), and **Verifier** (Service Provider), with the blockchain acting as the immutable trust layer.

sequenceDiagram
    participant I as 🏛️ Issuer (Bank)
    participant U as 📱 Holder (User App)
    participant V as 🏢 Verifier (Mutual Fund)
    participant B as ⛓️ Polygon Blockchain

    Note over I, U: Phase 1: Issuance (One-Time)
    I->>U: Verifies Docs & Issues Signed VC (Token)
    U->>U: Stores VC in Encrypted Vault

    Note over U, V: Phase 2: Presentation
    V->>U: Requests Proof: "Are you > 18?"
    U->>U: Generates ZK-Proof (No PII revealed)
    U->>V: Sends ZK-Proof

    Note over V, B: Phase 3: Verification
    V->>B: Reads Registry (Is Issuer valid? Is VC revoked?)
    B-->>V: Returns: ✅ Valid
    V->>U: Instant Onboarding 🚀
```

### Workflow Breakdown

**Phase 1: Issuance (One-Time Setup)**
- A trusted authority (Bank/CKYCR) verifies the user's documents
- Issues a digitally signed Verifiable Credential (VC)
- User stores this VC in their encrypted mobile wallet

**Phase 2: Presentation (When Needed)**
- Service provider requests a proof (e.g., "Are you over 18?")
- User's wallet generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof locally
- Only the proof is sent—no personal data leaves the device

**Phase 3: Verification (Instant)**
- Verifier checks the blockchain to confirm:
  - Is the issuer valid? (IssuerRegistry)
  - Is the credential revoked? (RevocationRegistry)
- Access granted within seconds

## 📱 User Experience (Gas-less & Simple)

A key barrier to blockchain adoption is complexity. We have abstracted away all crypto-related friction. The user experience is designed to be as simple as a standard UPI app.

The user simply presses a button to generate a proof. There are no gas fees and no complex wallet interactions.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This monorepo contains the end-to-end implementation of the MyPersona infrastructure:

### 1. `/kyc-contracts` ⛓️
The on-chain trust layer deployed on Polygon Amoy.

- **IssuerRegistry.sol**: Whitelist of authorized banks/CKYCR nodes.
- **RevocationRegistry.sol**: Handles real-time credential revocation (e.g., lost devices).

**Tech Stack**: Solidity, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin.

### 2. `/issuer-portal` 🏛️
The admin dashboard for banks/regulators.

- Allows institutions to perform KYC and mint Verifiable Credentials to users.
- Manages the "Emergency Freeze" and Revocation controls.

**Tech Stack**: Node.js, React, Ethers.js.

### 3. `/user-app` 📱
The consumer-facing mobile wallet.

- Stores credentials securely using AES-256 encryption.
- Contains the local ZKP Generator (Circom/SnarkJS) to create proofs offline.

**Tech Stack**: React Native, SnarkJS.

### 4. `/verifier-service` 🏢
The integration service for Fintechs (e.g., Insurance/Lending apps).

- Generates QR codes for proof requests.
- Verifies incoming ZK-Proofs against the blockchain.

**Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express, Polygon ID SDK.

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

- **PMLA Compliance**: We adhere to the Data Minimization principles of the DPDP Act 2023.
- **Audit Trail**: The RevocationRegistry maintains an immutable log of credential validity without storing PII on-chain.
- **Encryption**: All local data is encrypted at rest; all transport is secured via DIDComm/TLS.
